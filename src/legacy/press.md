#### Why did we make this?
There are a lot of tools that aim to give you an overview of your finances. Nearly all of them are free to use and make money through recommending other financial products or selling your data on to a third party. We thought there might be room for an ad-free, uncluttered, and lightning fast native Mac app that some people would be willing to pay for. When [Mint discontinued their menubar app](https://mint.lc.intuit.com/questions/1244369-discontinuing-the-mac-quickview-app), we thought there was an opportunity to fill the void.

#### How is it different?
- **Native to the Mac:** Your financial information is instantly accessible in the menubar.
- **Lightning fast:** Transactions are downloaded in the background and securely stored on the Mac which makes search instant and navigation really quick.
- **Powerful search:** Search tokens make it easier to find transactions within date ranges or certain amounts.
- **Custom notifications:** Create rules that scan incoming transactions and trigger notifications.
- **Insights:** See a breakdown of your spending, where you've spent the most money, and new merchants you've transacted with.
- **No ads:** You will never see recommendations for credit cards or other financial products.

#### Use of New Apple API's
- **Touch ID:** People can unlock Balance instantly using their fingerprint.
- **Touch Bar:** Navigate your accounts and transactions quickly with full Touch Bar support.
- **Subscriptions:** We are using Apple’s improved Subscription API to cover the cost of development and connecting to banks.

#### Pricing
- **Basic:** $4.99 a month for 5 accounts.
- **Medium:** $9.99 a month for 10 accounts.
- **Pro:** $19.99 a month for 20 accounts.

#### Who made this?
- **Ben Baron:** Worked at Apple as an engineer on Photos for Mac.
- **Christian Baroni:** Designed icons and interfaces for Microsoft and Stripe.
- **Richard Burton:** Worked on early interface concepts for the Ethereum project.
